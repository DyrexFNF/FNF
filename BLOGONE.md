<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BLOG 3-30-21</strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hey there! Hope ya'll are having an amazing day today, or tomorrow, or whenever you're viewing this. In this blog for today, I want to discuss the progress of our website and what we're adding in the near future. First off, I want to thank everyone who uses DyrexFNF. I've been putting off hard work and dedication towards it and I feel it paid off. Now back to the topic, I'm sorry they're limited mods on the website. How I bring the mods to my website is from bobydobs github page. And as of now he recently added the BSIDES mod, so it does tell me he's active and is updating it. Next update for the game most likely wont be a mod, it will probably be Week 7, as it is scheduled to come out very soon. Well, that's it! I'll hope to add on to the Blogs page every once in a while. Catch you all later!!</p>
