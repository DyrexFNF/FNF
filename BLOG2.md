<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BLOG 2 (4-5-21)</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello everyone! Welcome to my second blog on DyrexFNF! I'm here today to talk about a couple of things, one of those things being Happy Easter! Even if you don't celebrate it, I hope you had a great Sunday. The second thing being, we are going to be opening up a feedback section to DyrexFNF. Completely optional, just want to know what people think about DyrexFNF and how I can improve it. I also apologize for the Whitty and Tricky mod for not working correctly, people are currently trying to find a fix for it. Also what I said about Week 7 last blog aged like milk so don't make any promises I give you lol. There also may be a slight chance I may not upload Week 7 because @ninja_muffin_99 hinted there may be some... stuff in Week 7. I'll continue to upload mods but don't be surprised if I don't upload it to the site. Well, that's it for today's blog! Hope ya'll have an amazing day. See ya!</p>
